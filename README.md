# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis: 
#### background of project

Working with FastLending, we wanted toestablish an accurate selector, for a quick and reliable model for predicting credit risk candidates for loans to lower default rates. Working with Jill, the lead data scientist on this project, I used a carefully selected classification, supervised Machine Learning Model (ML model) on prepared data to which to apply statistical reasoning.

## Summary: 
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, 

include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. 
If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
