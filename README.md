# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis: 
#### background of project

Working with FastLending, we wanted toestablish an accurate selector, for a quick and reliable model for predicting credit risk candidates for loans to lower default rates. Working with Jill, the lead data scientist on this project, I used a carefully selected classification, supervised Machine Learning Model (ML model) on prepared data to which to apply statistical reasoning.

#### purpose of this analysis
The purpose is mainly to establish which ML model is better at predicting credit risk through resampling and combinatorial approaches, sampling six ML models.

## Results of Six Machine Learning Models:
#### the balanced accuracy scores (xx.xx%) :
    - Naive RandomOversampler : 60.28%
    - SMOTE Oversampling : 60.28%
    - ClusterCentroids Resampler: 63.29%
    - SMOTEENN: 49.82%
    - Random Forest Classifier
    -

#### the precision score 
    - Naive RandomOversampler : 
    - SMOTE Oversampling : .01
    - ClusterCentroids Resampler:
    - SMOTEENN:
    - Random Forest Classifier
    - EasyEnsembleClassifier

##### recall score
    - Naive RandomOversampler : 
    - SMOTE Oversampling : .57
    - ClusterCentroids Resampler:
    - SMOTEENN:
    - Random Forest Classifier
    - EasyEnsembleClassifier

Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary: 
When comparing the scores rounded to the 100th decimal place, we can see the th e___ method proves to be most effective by a narrow margin 
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, 

include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. 
If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
